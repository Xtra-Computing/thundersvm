# ThunderSVM How To
This page is for key instructions of intalling, using and contributing to ThunderSVM. ThunderSVM has been used by many users, and everyone can contribute to ThunderSVM to make it better.

## Install ThunderSVM

Please refer to [Getting Started](get-started.html) for installation and some examples of training SVMs using ThunderSVM.

## How can I do grid search?
   Since ThunderSVM supports cross-validation, you can write a simple grid.sh script like the following one. Then run ``` sh grid.sh [dataset]```.  You may modify the script to meet your needs. Indeed, ThunderSVM supports the same command line parameters as LIBSVM. So the script grid.py in LIBSVM can be used for ThunderSVM with minor modifications.
```
#!/usr/bin/bash
DATASET=$1
OPTIONS=
N_FOLD=5
for c in 1 3 10 30 100
do
  for g in 0.1 0.3 1 3 10
    do
      bin/thundersvm-train -c ${c} -g ${g} -v ${N_FOLD} ${OPTIONS} ${DATASET}
    done
done
```

## Improve documentations
Most of the documents can be viewed on GitHub, although the documents look much better in Read the Doc. The HTML files of our documents are generated by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/), and the source files of the documents are written using [Markdown](http://commonmark.org/). In the following, we describe how to setup the Sphinx environment for ThunderSVM.

* Install sphinx
```bash
pip install sphinx
```

* Install Makedown Parser
```bash
pip install recommonmark
```
Note that ```recommonmark``` has a bug when working with Sphinx in some platforms, so you may need to hack into transform.py to fix the problem by yourself. You can find the instruction of hacking in [this link](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3800).

* Install Sphinx theme
```bash
pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
```

* Generate HTML

   Go to the "docs" directory of ThunderSVM and run:
```bash
make html
```

At this point, make sure you have generated the documents of ThunderSVM. You can build the documents in your machine to see the outcome.

## Contribute to ThunderSVM
You need to fetch the latest version of ThunderSVM before submitting a pull request.
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm.git
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```

### Test ThunderSVM
We recommend our contributors using Linux as the development platform where ThunderSVM is relatively well tested.

Please note that ```cmake .. [-D<options>=<args>]``` produces a  ```CMakeCache.txt``` file. You need to remove it or the whole ```build``` directory, before you can run a new ```cmake``` command with different configurations. Also please note that the test build will not generate binaries like `thundersvm-train`.
#### Build test on Linux
* Clone ThunderSVM repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm.git
git submodule update --init src/test/googletest
```

* Build the binary for testing
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
make -j runtest
```
If ```make -j runtest``` doesn't work, please use ```make runtest``` instead. Make sure all the test cases pass. You can also add more test cases in the test module of ThunderSVM.

#### Build test on MacOS
* Clone ThunderSVM repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm.git
git submodule init eigen && git submodule update
git submodule update --init src/test/googletest
```

* Build the binary for testing
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=[path_to_g++]/usr/local/bin/g++-7 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=[path_to_gcc] -DUSE_CUDA=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
make -j runtest
```
Where ```[path_to_g++]``` and ```[path_to_gcc]``` typically look like ```/usr/local/bin/g++-7``` and ```/usr/local/bin/gcc-7```, respectively.

#### Build test on Windows
* Clone ThunderSVM repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm.git
git submodule update --init src/test/googletest
```

* Build the binary for testing
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS=TRUE -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=TRUE -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"
cmake --build . --target runtest
```
You need to change the Visual Studio version if you are using a different version of Visual Studio. Visual Studio can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/). The above commands generate some Visual Studio project files, open the Visual Studio project to build ThunderSVM. Please note that CMake should be 3.4 or above for Windows.

#### Build python wheel file
You have to ensure the repository is identical to the latest one.
* Clone ThunderSVM repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm.git
```
* Build the binary
```base
cd thundersvm
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j
```
* Build the python wheel file
    - change directory to python
    `cd ../python`
    - update the version you are going to release in [setup.py](https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm/blob/1d320932c66e60610669165db25aa4a83e118a70/python/setup.py#L21)
```bash
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
```
* Upload the wheel file to [Pypi.org](https://pypi.org)
```sybase
twine upload dist/* --verbose
```
* [Recommended] Draw a new release on [Release](https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm/releases)
    * state the bug fixed or new functions.
